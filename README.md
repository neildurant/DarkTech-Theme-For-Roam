# DarkTech Theme for Roam Research

This is my current dark theme for [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com). It's still a work in progress, and not all elements are fully styled/polished. If you find any element that need to be changed, please let me know.

## How to use

The theme can be installed in at least two ways:

### Stylus
You can use the [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) browser extension, then copy paste the CSS to apply theme. 

### Roam's in-built theme system
* Create a new page in roam, named 'roam/css'
* Add a code block, using ```
* Paste the CSS into the code block to apply the theme
